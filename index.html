<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I am currently a student at Eastern Washington University, majoring in Game Development and Animation. I love programming, 3D, animation, and design - anything that you can create and interact with. As an animation enthusiast and avid gamer, I enjoy working on lots of different projects and have learned development for desktop applications, web design, Android apps, Flash, and Unity, as well as design in 3DS Max and Photoshop. </p>

<p>In the future, I&#39;m hoping to work for a small game development company where I can work as part of a team.</p>

   <figcaption>Dungeon Gauntlet is a game that I worked on with 3 fellow students for a game development class. It is a 2D platformer made in ActionScript 3.0, with the use of the Flixel Engine. I created all of the artwork used in the game, and helped to program the level generation system, sound fx, &amp; player attacks. You can play this game on Newgrounds!

   <figcaption>This project, created for a design patterns class, was completed by myself and two other students. I acted as the team lead, and collaborated with the others to design the game flow, look and feel, and content of the game. I encouraged the use of a Game Design Document, divided the work between everyone, and created the game with design patterns as a guide. In addition, I created all of the in-game artwork, helped with creating the tile-maps, and programmed the turn-based fighting system.</figcaption>

   <figcaption>This project was intended to improve my low poly modeling and texturing skills in 3D. Given blueprints and the appropriate graphics for the textures, I created these three models. It was a very interesting and worthwhile project, and I very much liked how they turned out.</figcaption>

   <figcaption>Done in my free time, these illustrations are all various pieces that I've worked on. Some were inspired by specific sights or ideas, and others were just done on the fly. They are all done on 18 x 24 in. pieces of sketchbook paper.</figcaption>

   <figcaption>One of my earlier projects made in 3D, this project was a recreation of the iconic Rainbow Road track from Mario Kart 64. While it turned out alright, this is one project that I would really like to come back to and recreate from the ground up.</figcaption>

   <figcaption>Created for a graphic design class, these ads were made to make us more familiar with fonts, styles, and effects in Photoshop. The Silent Hill one in particular was really interesting to try to make as creepy and unsettling as possible with the tools available.</figcaption>

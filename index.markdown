## Bio
Hi there, I am currently a student at Eastern Washington University, majoring in Game Development and Animation. I love programming, 3D, animation, and design - anything that you can create and interact with. As an animation enthusiast and avid gamer, I enjoy working on lots of different projects and have learned development for desktop applications, web design, Android apps, Flash, and Unity, as well as design in 3DS Max and Photoshop. 

In the future, I'm hoping to work for a small game development company where I can work as part of a team.

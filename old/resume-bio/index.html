<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>I am currently a student at Eastern Washington University, majoring in Game Development and Animation. I love programming, 3D, animation, and design - anything that you can create and interact with. As an animation enthusiast and avid gamer, I enjoy working on lots of different projects and have learned development for desktop applications, web design, Android apps, Flash, and Unity, as well as design in 3DS Max and Photoshop. </p>

<p>In the future, I&#39;m hoping to work for a small game development company where I can work as part of a team.</p>
